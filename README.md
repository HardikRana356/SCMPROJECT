# SCMPROJECT
	We are hosting our project “ANAGRAMS” on GITHUB.
	It is a two-player game which allows players to choose their difficulty level
{Easy/Medium/Hard} and formulate words using the given letters.
	We constructed this game because it promotes healthy-competition, good use of free time and will to learn new meaningful words.
	We used GITHUB for the purpose of collaboration with our team members as building this game requires useful input from 3 people based on their knowledge of words and literature.
	GITHUB helps controlling all the versions of the webpage.
